# Feature Name: `ui-systems-callbacks`

## Summary

When combined with ordinary systems, commands stored as components on UI entities offer a powerful and expressive callback-like paradigm for one-off UI behavior.

## Motivation

Bevy's ECS is a powerful and expressive tool for arbitrary computation and scheduling.
However, it tends to struggle badly when one-off behaviors are needed, resulting in both excessive boilerplate and a huge proliferation of systems that must run each and every frame.

This is particularly relevant when it comes to designing the logic behind user interfaces, which are littered with special-cased, complex functions with very low performance demands.

## User-facing explanation

When building user interfaces in Bevy, data flows through three conceptual stages:

1. **Input.** Raw keyboard, mouse, joystick events and so on are received. These are handled by various **input dispatching** systems, and converted into actions, with tangible game-specific meaning.
2. **Action.** Entities in our world (whether they're game objects or interactive **UI elements**) receive actions and change data.
3. **Reaction.** Other systems watch for changes or events produced by the UI elements that changed, and react to finish the tasks they started.

In this chapter, we're going to discuss patterns you can use in Bevy to design user interfaces that map cleanly to this data flow, allowing them to be modified, built upon and debugged without the spaghetti.

Once we've added an interactive UI element to our `World` (think a button, form or mini-map), we need to get actions to it in some form.
The simplest way to do this would be to listen to the input events yourself, and then act if an appropriate event is heard.

```rust
// This system is added to CoreStage::Ui to ensure that it runs at the appropriate time
fn my_button(mut query: Query<(&Interaction, &mut Counter), 
			                  (With<MyButton>, Changed<Interaction>)>){
	// Extract the components on the button in question
	// and see if it was clicked in the last frame
	let (interaction, mut counter) = query.single_mut().unwrap();
	if *interaction == Interaction::Clicked {
		*counter += 1;
	}
}
```

However, this conflation of inputs and actions starts to get tricky if we want to add a keybinding that performs the same behavior.
Do we duplicate the logic? Mock the mouse input event to the correct button?
Instead, the better approach is to separate inputs from actions, and use the built-in **event-queue** that comes with our `ButtonBundle`.

```rust
// Each of our buttons have an `Events<Action>` component,
// which stores a data-less event recording that it has been clicked.
// Adding your own `Events<T>` components with special data to UI elements is easy;
// simply add it to your custom bundle on spawn.

// Action events are automatically added to entities 
// with an Interaction component when they are clicked on
// Here, we're adding a second route to the same end, triggering when "K" is pressed
fn my_button_hotkey(mut query: Query<&mut EventWriter<Actions>, With<MyButton>>, keyboard_input: Res<KeyboardInput>){
	if keyboard_input.just_pressed(KeyCode::K){
		let button_action_writer = query.single_mut().unwrap();
		// Sends a single, dataless event to our MyButton entity
		button_action_writer.send(Action);
	}
}

// We can use the EventReader<Action> sugar to ergonomically read the events stored on our buttons
fn my_button(mut query: Query<(&mut EventReader<Action>, &mut Counter), With<MyButton>>){
	// Extract the components on the button in question
	// and see if it was clicked in the last frame
	let (actions, mut counter) = query.single_mut().unwrap();
	for _ in actions {
		*counter += 1;
	}
}
```

As you can see, decoupling inputs and actions in this way makes our code more robust (since it can handle multiple inputs in a single frame), and dramatically more extensible, without adding any extra boilerplate.
If we wanted to, we could add another system that read the same `Events<Action>` component on our `MyButton` entity, reading these events completely independently to perform new behavior each time either the button was clicked or "K" was pressed.

Finally, we can use this decoupling to ensure that only valid inputs get turned into actions, by making sure that our systems runs after the `bevy::input::SystemLabels::InputDispatch` system label during the `CoreStage::PreUpdate` stage.
Input is converted to actions during systems with those labels, so we can intercept it before it is seen by any systems in our `Update` or `Input` stages.

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;
use bevy::input::SystemLabels;

fn main(){
	App::build()
		.add_system_to_stage(CoreStage::PreUpdate, 
			verify_cooldowns.system().after(SystemLabels::InputDispatch))
		.run();
}

/// Ignores all inputs to Cooldown-containing entities that are not ready
fn verify_cooldowns(mut query: Query<&Cooldown, &mut Events<Action>>){
	for cooldown, mut actions in query.iter_mut(){
		if !cooldown.finished{
			actions.clear();
		}
	}
}
```

### Generalizing behavior

Of course, we don't *really* want to make a separate system and marker component for every single button that we create.
Not only does this result in heavy code duplication, it also imposes a small (but non-zero) overhead for each system in our schedule every tick.
Furthermore, if the number of buttons isn't known at compile time, we *can't* just make more systems.

Commonly though, we will have many related UI elements: unit building an RTS, ability buttons in a MOBA, options in a drop-down menu.
These will have similar, but not identical behavior, allowing us to move data from the *components* of the entity into an *event*, commonly of the exact same type.
In this way, we can use a single system to differentiate behavior.

```rust
// Operates over any ability buttons we may have in a single system
fn ability_buttons(mut query: Query<(&mut EventReader<Action>, &mut Timer<Cooldown>, &Ability)>, time: Res<Time>, mut ability_events: EventWriter<Ability>){
	for actions, cooldown, ability in query.iter_mut(){
		// Tick down our cooldown timers
		cooldown.tick(time.delta());
		
		for _ in actions {
			// You can only use abilities that are off cooldown!
			if cooldown.finished(){
				// Creates a global ability event using the data for other systems to handle
				// This should include the originating `Entity` as a field of `Ability`, 
				// along with other data about its effects
				ability_events.send(ability);
			}
		}
	}
}
```

We can extend this pattern further, with the use of **generic systems**, allowing us to quickly create systems for new types of interactable UI elements.

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

fn main(){
	App::build()
		.add_event::<NewPuzzle>()
		.add_system_to_stage(CoreStage::Input, puzzle_button::<NewPuzzle>.system())
		.add_event::<ResetPuzzle>()
		.add_system_to_stage(CoreStage::Input, puzzle_button::<ResetPuzzle>.system())		
		.add_event::<WriteNumber>()
		.add_system_to_stage(CoreStage::Input, puzzle_button::<WriteNumber>.system())
		.run()
}

// Dataless structs that double as components and events
struct NewPuzzle;
struct ResetPuzzle;
// Also passes the correct number stored in the button into the puzzle game's logic
struct WriteNumber(u8);

/// Sends the event type associated with the button when pressed
/// using the data stored on the component of that type
fn puzzle_button<T: Component + Clone>(
    query: Query<(&Interaction, &T)>,
    mut event_writer: EventWriter<T>,
) {
    for (interaction, marker) in query.iter() {
        if *interaction == Interaction::Clicked {
            event_writer.send(marker.clone());
        }
    }
}
```

### Specializing behavior

In certain cases though, you may need to have a very large number of UI elements, each with entirely custom behavior.
Rather than running one (or more!) system per button, you can use a more advanced **callback pattern** using `Callback` components which store a command.
This command is applied once for each time an `Action` event is received by your entity, taking effect at the end of the current stage.

Under the hood, these are processed by the `callback_system` function found in `CoreStage::Ui`. The `Callback` type and this built-in system are *remarkably* simple:

```rust
/// `Callback` components are automatically run as commands when 
enum Callback {
	/// Commands that affecting the global state broadly
	Command(Commands),
	/// Commands that affect a single entity, stored in this enum
	EntityCommand(Entity, EntityCommands),
	/// Commands that affect only the entity that has this component
	SelfCommand(EntityCommands),
}

/// Applies the `Callback` component of entities once for each `Action` event that they have
fn callback_system(mut commands: Commands, mut query: Query<(Entity, &mut EventReader<Action>, &Callback)>){
	for (self_e, mut actions, callback) in query.iter_mut(){
		// For each Action (triggered by inputs) that our entity receives
		for _ in actions {
			// Run the command referenced in the `Callback` component of our entity
			// at the end of the current stage
			match Callback {
				Callback::Command(command) => commands.apply(command),
				EntityCommand::EntityCommand(e, e_command) => commands.entity(e).apply(e_command),
				Callback::SelfCommand(e_command) => commands.entity(self_e).apply(e_command),
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Adding callbacks to your UI elements is straightforward: simply add the appropriate `Callback` struct as a component.

```rust
// This button will spawn a new unit when pressed
commands.spawn_bundle(ButtonBundle::default())
	.with(Callback::Command(Commands::new().spawn_bundle(UnitBundle::default())));

// This button will overwrite the value of the `GameDifficulty` resource when pressed
commands.spawn_bundle(ButtonBundle::default())
	.with(Callback::Command(Commands::new().insert_resource(GameDifficulty::Hard));

// This button will add the `InCombat` marker component to the `player_entity` Entity when pressed
commands.spawn_bundle(ButtonBundle::default())
	.with(Callback::EntityCommand(player_entity, EntityCommands::new().insert(InCombat)));

// This button will despawn itself when pressed
commands.spawn_bundle(ButtonBundle::default())
	.with(Callback::SelfCommand(EntityCommands::new().despawn()));
```

Remember that you can create your own **custom commands**, giving you the ability to express arbitrary logic using callbacks.
For moderately complex, one-off cases though, you may prefer to combine `Callback` with the `run_system` command to quickly execute systems of your own design in a one-shot fashion when UI elements are activated.

```rust
/// Powers up all of our towers when this system runs
fn supercharge_towers(mut query: Query<(&mut Damage, &mut AttackSpeed), With<Tower>>){
	for mut damage, mut attack_speed in query.iter_mut(){
		*damage *= 2.0;
		*attack_speed *= 2.0; 
	}
}

/// Runs the supercharge_towers system once when this button is activated
commands.spawn_bundle(ButtonBundle::default())
	.with(Callback::Command(Commands::new().run_system(supercharge_towers.system())));
```

### Reacting to UI

Once your UI has responded to actions, you may want to respond to its consequences in a downstream fashion.
There are three good tools to do so:

1. **Change detection:** Using `Changed<T>` query filters (or `.is_changed()` for resources), respond to changes in the data.
2. **Global events:** Emit and then listen for an event as a resource using `EventWriter` and `EventReader` as system parameters.
3. **Entity-specific events:** Emit and then listen for an event as a component using `EventWriter` and `EventReader` as query parameters.

Change detection should be your default tool for simple cases: it is fast, perfectly reliable and does not involve the creation of any new types.
Simply read the new value of the data and respond accordingly.

Events are useful when you need to store more than one possible event, or want to encode additional data.
Use entity-specific events when the effects of your action are well-localized to a single entity, and global events otherwise.

## Implementation strategy

This proposal's functionality depends on:

1. Per-entity events: [PR](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/2116), [perf improvements](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/2073). This is essential to achieving nice ergonomics around input mapping and action responses.
2. Implementing a command chaining API. This should be fairly simple: it just requires implementing a `.apply` method on both `Commands` and `EntityCommands` which appends the second list of commands to the first.
3. A standardized label for input dispatch that's used by core and community plugins, and a new `CoreStage::Input`. These are essential to help reduce system ordering headaches.
4. \[Optional\] The ability to run one-shot systems with commands: [issue](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/2192), [PR](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/2234).

## Drawbacks

1. Callbacks have arbitrary power. If not carefully managed, this could create terrible spaghetti.
2. Callbacks, like other commands, operate sequentially. This is problematic for high performance applications.
3. There are several equivalent ways to achieve the same outcome. This choice is mostly dictated by ergonomics and subtle (but typically irrelevant) perf considerations.
4. Serialization of callback components is likely to be challenging.

## Rationale and alternatives

### Why is it helpful to use the ECS for our UI logic?

1. Familiar to Bevy programmers.
2. Trivially integrated with game logic.
3. Incredibly expressive.
4. Benefits from other engine improvements and reduces maintenance burden.

### Why do we need to add this as an engine feature?

While very little code will need to be added *specifically* for this pattern,
it is vitally important to demonstrate complex patterns in an opinionated way to users.

This allows for the creation of a standardized, interoperable ecosystem,
and guides users towards a sensible, performant and maintainable set of patterns when building their own user interfaces.

### Why do we want callbacks?

UI, much like scripting, tends to involve a large number of special-cased behaviors, in direct opposition to the natural patterns promoted by the ECS architecture.
The callback pattern (and more generally, hooks) allows us to express this logic in a sane and maintainable fashion.

Theoretically, everything that users could do with the callback pattern could be done with one-off systems.
However, this clutters our scheduler (possibly hurting performance), reduces clarity and hurts compile times due to a huge number of one-off types.
Furthermore, by storing specialized logic as data directly on UI entities it makes it dramatically easier to debug and reason about customized behavior.

### Why don't we need a more complex reactivity model?

Most reaction chains in UI are shockingly short.
The most complex patterns are:

1. Changing UI appearance en-masse: styles and themes should be used for this.
2. Changing which UI elements are displayed (e.g. swapping tabs, pulling up a menu): this is precisely what `on_enter` and `on_exit` system sets in `States` are intended to solve.
3. Handling layout changes: this should be done automatically in a single system (or group of systems) that runs in `CoreStage::PostUpdate`, rather than being scatter across our logic.

For everything else, change detection and events should be more than adequate.

By sticking to a straightforward imperative model of UI behavior combined with decoupled reactivity,
we can make complex user interfaces dramatically easier to reason about, refactor and debug.

## Unresolved questions

- How do we serialize and deserialize callback components?
- How can we ergonomically control the order in which callback commands are executed?
- Should we special-case UI callbacks for now, or create a generalized `Hook` trait from the very beginning?

## Future work

1. We may want to loop over UI in some way to ensure that everything is resolved properly.
2. The `EntityCommand` variant of `Callback` may be better handled using `Relations` in some form in the future.
3. The ergonomics and performance of the callback pattern will be improved with other possible improvements to commands, namely more immediate processing, parallel execution and better control over execution order.
4. Accessing and modifying the behavior of other entities within a UI hierarchy *can* be done as is, but will be much more ergonomic with advanced relations features like the ability to query for data on the target entity.
5. Create a `QueryCommands` type (which applies the command to every entity matching a given query), and then extend callbacks to support this use as well.

### A generalized hook framework

The callback pattern, once established for UI (or immediately, if there's appetite for it), can be easily extended to create powerful and expressive **entity hooks**.
This allows for the ad-hoc creation of safe and performant APIs for scripting-like one-off behavior without a huge proliferation of systems in our schedule.

To do so, all we need is a simple trait that wraps our `Callback` component and a trivial generic system.

```rust
pub trait Hook {
	pub fn callback(&self) -> &Callback {}

	pub fn events(&mut self) -> Events<Self> {}

	// Convenience function for creating new component with this trait
	// That automatically initializes the Events field
	pub fn new(Callback) -> Self {}
}

// This system could be added for `H = ActionHook` instead of implementing `callback_system` in the core plugins to avoid special-casing
// HookReader (and HookWriter) is just a simple variation on the standard EventReader parameters to allow us to store additional data on one component
pub fn add_hook<H: Hook + Component>(mut query: Query<&mut HookReader<H>, mut commands: Commands>){
	// Operates on all entities with an `Events<H>` component
	for hook_events in query.iter_mut(){
		for hook_event in hook_event{
			match hook_event.callback() {
				Callback::Command(command) => commands.apply(command),
				EntityCommand::EntityCommand(e, e_command) => commands.entity(e).apply(e_command),
				Callback::SelfCommand(e_command) => commands.entity(self_e).apply(e_command),
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Hooks might be "whenever this entity dies", "when damage is taken", "when a unit is at full health" or whatever else is relevant to the specific game or application.
Each of these event queues would be populated in their own game-logic specific system,
and then these hooks could be exposed as an API to various scripting-like parts of the game.

This pattern allows us to customize behavior in arbitrarily complex ways in a more efficient fashion (using one system per hook, rather than per behavior), and opens the door to programming flexible behaviors without having to write them directly as Rust code.

Let's take a look at a more complete example of how this might look.

```rust
use bevy::prelude::*;

fn main(){
	App::build()
		// Runs the commands cached in the OnDeath component of each entity during CoreStage::update()
		.add_hook::<OnDeath>()
		// Adds some slimes to our world
		.add_startup_system(spawn_slimes.system())
		// Set the OnDeath component before the hook is checked to avoid frame delays
		.add_system(change_life.system().before(HookLabel(OnDeath)))
}

#[derive(Hook)]
struct OnDeath{
	callback: Callback
	events: Events<OnDeath>
};

impl Default for OnDeath{
	fn default() -> Self {
		let commands = EntityCommands::new().despawn();
		OnDeath::new(Callback::SelfCommand(commands))
	}
} 

struct Life(isize);

/// Shared bundle type for all of the creatures in our game
#[derive(Bundle)]
struct CreatureBundle {
	sprite: Sprite,
	transform: Transform,
	life: Life,
	life_events: Events<Life>
	/*
		Many other useful fields go here
	*/
}

struct LittleSlime;
const LITTLE_SLIME_LIFE: isize = 100;

#[derive(Bundle)]
struct LittleSlimeBundle {
	marker: LittleSlime,
	on_death: Events<OnDeath>,
	#[bundle]
	creature_bundle: CreatureBundle
}

impl LittleSlimeBundle {
	fn new(x: f32, y: f32, sprite: Handle<ColorMaterial>) -> Self {
		LittleSlimeBundle{
			marker: LittleSlime,
			creature_bundle: CreatureBundle {
				sprite,
				transform: Transform::from_xyz(x, y, 1.0),
				life: LITTLE_SLIME_LIFE,
				// Implicitly adds the OnDeath component with 
				..Default::default()
			}
		}
	}
}

struct BigSlime;
const BIG_SLIME_LIFE: isize = 100;

#[derive(Bundle)]
struct BigSlimeBundle {
	marker: BigSlime,
	on_death: OnDeath,
	#[bundle]
	creature_bundle: CreatureBundle
}

impl BigSlimeBundle {
	fn new(x: f32, y: f32, sprite: Handle<ColorMaterial>) -> Self {
		// By mutating our commands object (just like in a system) 
		// we can create complex behavior without the need for custom Commands
		let mut commands = EntityCommands::new();
		commands.remove::<BigSlime>();
		commands.insert(LittleSlime);
		// Overwrites old value of Life component
		commands.insert(Life(LITTLE_SLIME_LIFE));
		let on_death = OnDeath::new(Callback::SelfCommand(command));
		
		BigSlimeBundle{
			marker: LittleSlime,
			creature_bundle: CreatureBundle {
				sprite,
				transform: Transform::from_xyz(x, y, 1.0),
				life: BIG_SLIME_LIFE,
				on_death,
				..Default::default()
			}
		}
	}
}

fn spawn_slimes(mut commands: Commands, asset_server: ResMut<AssetServer>){
	/*
		Eliding tedious asset loading logic
	*/

	commands.spawn_bundle(LittleSlimeBundle::new(0.0, 1.0, little_slime_handle));
	commands.spawn_bundle(BigSlimeBundle::new(3.0, 5.0, big_slime_handle));
}

/// Applies damage and healing to each creature
fn change_life(mut query: Query<(&mut Life, &mut EventReader<Life>, &mut HookWriter<OnDeath>)>){
	for (mut life, mut life_events, mut on_death) in query.iter_mut() {
		for event in life_events {
			life.0 += event.0;
		}

		if life <= 0 {
			// This event queue will almost always have exactly 0 or 1 events, 
			// because creatures should only be dying once
			// However this would be quite different for an OnHit hook
			on_death.send(OnDeath);
		}
	}
}

```
